# Backend Setup

This folder will contain the backend services for the distributed application. The backend will include the following components:

1. **Workflow Orchestrator**: Manages state transitions and event-driven workflows.
2. **Event Bus**: Facilitates communication between components.
3. **Worker Services**: Perform specific tasks in the workflow.
4. **Audit Service**: Tracks historical data and logs events.

## Next Steps
- Initialize a Node.js or Python project.
- Set up the Workflow Orchestrator.
- Implement the Event Bus.
