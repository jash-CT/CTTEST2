# Database Setup

This folder will contain the database configuration and scripts for the distributed application. The database will store:

1. **Workflow States**: Current states of workflows.
2. **User Roles**: Information about user roles and permissions.
3. **Historical Data**: Logs and historical data for workflows.

## Next Steps
- Set up a PostgreSQL database.
- Create tables for workflows, users, and logs.
